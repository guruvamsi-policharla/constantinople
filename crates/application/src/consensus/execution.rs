//! Execution and commitment checks for consensus blocks.
//!
//! This module is the consensus-facing wrapper around the account executor. It
//! prepares block bodies, stages the state needed for account execution,
//! computes final account values and transaction-history updates, and returns
//! the merkleized commitments that consensus proposes, verifies, or applies.
//!
//! The important invariant is that account execution is based on block-start
//! state. Nonces and spends are sender-local, and credits from this block are
//! not available for spending until the block has finished executing. Because of
//! that rule, execution can build deterministic account effects from the
//! transfer list before looking at account state, then apply those effects to
//! loaded accounts all or nothing.

//! merkleized commitments
//! ```
//!
//! The account-touch plan has two lanes. The discrete lane contains only
//! transfers whose non-self sender and recipient accounts are unique in the
//! block, so each loaded account produces exactly one final write. The general
//! lane contains every transfer that touches a contended account. It aggregates
//! one effect per affected account: sent nonces, non-self debit total,
//! self-transfer affordability floor, and recipient credit total. The account is
//! loaded once, checked once, and written once. Credits are added after debit
//! affordability is checked, so an in-block credit cannot fund an in-block
//! spend. If any debit check or credit addition fails in either lane, the whole
//! batch is rejected; there is no partial execution state to reconcile.
//!
//! Account state is loaded with one awaited QMDB `stage` call, which returns
//! the loaded values plus a staged batch that retains each key's resolved
//! location. Every staged account produces exactly one final value, so the
//! writes are `(staged read index, account)` updates that skip key
//! re-resolution when the staged batch merkleizes. Transaction history is
//! append-only: transaction digests are appended in block order, so the
//! transaction-history commitment still reflects block order.
//!
//! Proposing, verifying, and applying certified blocks all use this same
//! transition. `execute_proposal` builds a proposal best effort: malformed or
//! inapplicable candidates are dropped individually, the block tops up from
//! the mempool toward the proposal budget, and an empty selection proposes an
//! empty block so an idle chain keeps making progress — a proposal is always
//! produced.
//! `execute_body` prepares a proposed body, recomputes execution, and compares
//! the resulting commitments to the header. Certified apply shallow-clones the
//! block's lazy body (per-transaction handles whose decode cache stays shared)
//! to move it into the pool's prepare job, without building an intermediate
//! materialized transaction vector. Preparing a transfer does
//! not invent a second transaction identifier: it reads the transaction's sealed
//! message digest. For lazily encoded block bodies, whichever consumer first
//! materializes the transaction computes that seal once and caches the decoded
//! transaction for the other consumers.
//!
//! Parallel fan-out comes from the supplied `Strategy`, which decides per
//! operation whether fanning out beats staying serial. The strategy drives
//! preparation and QMDB merkleization beneath the batch APIs; per-account
//! mutation is a few instructions per account, so it runs as one serial pass.
//! QMDB reads stay on the async path and are not run inside `Strategy`
//! workers.
