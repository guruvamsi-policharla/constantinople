//! Constantinople consensus engine wiring.
//!
//! This crate assembles the full validator stack around
//! [`constantinople_application`]:
//!
//! - stateful QMDB management
//! - erasure-coded marshal
//! - fixed-epoch threshold simplex consensus
//!
//! The public API stays narrow. [`Engine`] owns the assembled actors and
//! [`Config`] describes the validator-specific inputs needed to initialize
//! them. Tests can drive the same engine under the deterministic runtime and
//! simulated networking.
