//! Reporters and uploader actors for indexer publishing.
//!
//! The publisher is split in two halves:
//!
//! - One or more cloneable [`Reporter`] implementations that encode incoming
//!   consensus events into atomic [`UploadBatch`]es and push them to a bounded
//!   MPSC channel.
//! - Three uploader tasks (see [`spawn_uploaders`]) — two KV stores plus
//!   one SQL metadata writer — that each own a [`StoreClient`] and drain
//!   their channel, retrying until the store accepts the batch. On
//!   success each task fulfills its clone of the marshal acknowledgement
//!   bundled with the batch (if any).
//!
//! Constantinople fans its data across two KV stores plus one SQL stream:
//!
//! | Path              | Families / tables                              |
//! | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
//! | `blocks` (KV)     | `BLOCK`, `BLOCK_BY_H`, `FINALIZED`, `NOTARIZED` |
//! | `transactions` (KV) | `TX`, `TX_BY_H`                              |
//! | `sql` (metadata)  | `block_meta`, `tx_meta`                        |
//!
//! The marshal [`Exact`] acknowledgement is cloned once per uploader so the
//! waiter resolves only after every path has durably accepted its batch.
//!
//! [`Reporter`]: commonware_consensus::Reporter
//! [`StoreClient`]: exoware_sdk::StoreClient
