//! Reporters and uploader actors for indexer publishing.
//!
//! The non-QMDB publisher is split in two halves:
//!
//! - One or more cloneable [`Reporter`] implementations that encode incoming
//!   consensus events into atomic [`UploadBatch`]es and push them to a bounded
//!   MPSC channel.
//! - Two uploader tasks (see [`spawn_uploaders`]) — one raw KV store plus
//!   one SQL metadata writer — that each own a [`StoreClient`] and drain
//!   their channel, retrying until the store accepts the batch. On
//!   success each task fulfills its clone of the marshal acknowledgement
//!   bundled with the batch (if any).
//!
//! Constantinople's metadata-only and non-QMDB full modes fan block data across
//! one raw KV stream plus one SQL stream:
//!
//! | Path             | Families / tables                                            |
//! | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
//! | `raw` (KV)       | `BLOCK`, `BLOCK_BY_H`, `TX`, `TX_BY_H`            |
//! | `sql` (metadata) | `block_meta`, `tx_meta`                                      |
//!
//! Simplex certificates are uploaded separately through [`CertificateReporter`]
//! using `exoware-simplex` indexes in the same Store.
//!
//! The marshal [`Exact`] acknowledgement is cloned once per uploader so the
//! waiter resolves only after every path has durably accepted its batch.
//! When QMDB upload is enabled on the single owning secondary,
//! [`QmdbPublisher`] replaces the block reporter and stages raw KV rows, SQL
//! rows, account-state QMDB rows, and transaction-hash QMDB rows into one
//! Store batch per finalized block.
//!
//! [`Reporter`]: commonware_consensus::Reporter
//! [`StoreClient`]: exoware_sdk::StoreClient
