//! SQL metadata publisher and uploader.
//!
//! This is the metadata-streaming half of the indexer's two-path layout
//! (see [`crate::sql_schema`] for the table definitions). Per finalized
//! `Update::Block` the [`BlockReporter`] dispatches a single [`SqlBatch`]
//! containing one [`crate::sql_schema::BLOCK_META_TABLE`] row. A dedicated
//! uploader task drains the channel, inserts every queued row into a reused
//! [`BatchWriter`], and flushes once for the drained batch.
//!
//! Failure model: the flush is retried indefinitely with the standard
//! `retry_backoff` ladder shared with the KV uploaders. The marshal
//! [`Exact`] acknowledgement cloned by the reporter is held until the
//! flush succeeds, so consensus back-pressures naturally if the SQL
//! store is unhealthy.
//!
//! [`BlockReporter`]: super::BlockReporter
//! [`BatchWriter`]: exoware_sql::BatchWriter
